[1.0.3]

[+] Added CHANGELOG file
[+] HEALTHCHECK for docker container
[+] Added push to github docker registry

[*] Improved settings handling and cleaned up code
[*] Removed leading and ending slash of environment variables JS_SUBDIRECTORY and GA_PLUGINS_DIRECTORYNAME
[*] Corrected wrong docker image tagging for upload to github in build.sh

[?] It seems like the www.googletagmanager.com/a endpoint returns a pixel instead of js code. Temporarily disable proxying for it.
